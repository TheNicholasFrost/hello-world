This repository is for getting familiar with Github's features.

Not much to say here.

I'll list some influences
Andrew Henry's Meadow
Setting up geodesic domes
Jean-Paul Sarte, though I am not sure he would approve. Or I'd want him to?
The good parts ogf the the good people and even the good parts of the not so great people.
The wind pushing the branches.
